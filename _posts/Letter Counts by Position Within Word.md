## letter count by position

Here  We show frequencies for positions relative to the end of the word: "-1" means the last letter, "-2" means the second to last, and so on. We can see that the frequencies vary quite a bit; for example, "e" is uncommon as the first letter (4 times less frequent than elsewhere); similarly "n" is 3 times less common as the first letter than it is overall. The letter "e" makes a comeback as the most common last letter (and also very common at 3rd and 5th letter places).
